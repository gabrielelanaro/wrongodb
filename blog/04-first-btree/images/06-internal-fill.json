A prominent title at the top reads 'Index Growth Mechanism: Leaf Splits Drive Root Directory Expansion'.\n\nPanel 1 (Left, labeled 'STAGE 1: Initial State (1 Separator)'): At the top, a rectangular blue container labeled 'Root Node (Slot Directory)' holds a single gray block marked 'Sep 50'. Below it, thick connecting lines point to two larger green rectangular containers labeled 'Leaf Node A (Keys < 50)' and 'Leaf Node B (Keys >= 50)'. Leaf A is partially filled with small data blocks; Leaf B is almost full.\n\nA large gray arrow points from Panel 1 to Panel 2.\n\nPanel 2 (Middle, labeled 'STAGE 2: Leaf Fill & Split Action'): Leaf B is now completely packed with data blocks and has a jagged red outline and a burst icon labeled 'FULL! SPLIT IN PROGRESS'. An upward-curving bright orange arrow labeled 'Promote Separator (75)' emerges from the splitting Leaf B, carrying a new gray block marked 'Sep 75' towards the Root Node. The Root Node at the top is shown expanding horizontally to accommodate the new block, now showing two slots: 'Sep 50 | [Empty Slot]'. Below the splitting leaf, faint outlines indicate it dividing into two smaller leaves.\n\nA large gray arrow points from Panel 2 to Panel 3.\n\nPanel 3 (Right, labeled 'STAGE 3: Root Growth Result'): The Root Node at the top is wider and now contains two distinct gray separator blocks: 'Sep 50 | Sep 75'. Below it, three green Leaf Nodes are connected: 'Leaf A', 'Leaf B1 (50-74)', and 'Leaf B2 (>= 75)'. A new annotation points to the Root Node saying 'Directory grown by one slot'.
