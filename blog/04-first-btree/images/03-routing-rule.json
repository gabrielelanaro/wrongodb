The layout is hierarchical, featuring a top 'Parent Routing Node' connected by prominent arrows to two lower rectangular containers labeled 'Left Leaf Node' and 'Right Leaf Node'. The Left Leaf Node contains a horizontal array of sorted data blocks: '[ 10 | 25 | 33 ]'. The Right Leaf Node contains: '[ *42* | 50 | 67 ]'. The first data block in the Right Leaf, '42', is visually emphasized with a bright orange highlight, a thicker border, and a tag element pointing to it labeled 'SEPARATOR KEY (First value in Right Leaf)'. Above within the Parent Routing Node, a flowchart element shows an 'Incoming Search Key (K)' icon pointing to a decision junction. From this junction, a thick orange arrow path labeled 'If K < 42' points down to the Left Leaf Node. Another thick orange arrow path labeled 'If K \u2265 42' points down to the Right Leaf Node. The background is a clean white with a subtle digital grid pattern. The overall palette uses cool grays and blues for structure, with distinct orange for the separator, routing paths, and active logic. Typography is a blend of technical monospace for data blocks and clean sans-serif for titles and logic labels.",
