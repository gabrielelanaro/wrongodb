  "prompt": "Clean technical diagram of B+tree split propagation with 4 panels in a 2x2 grid. Thin light-grey panel borders, white background with a faint grid. Keep a consistent layout in all panels: internal nodes near the top, leaf nodes near the bottom. Child pointers are straight vertical blue arrows (no diagonals). Left-to-right position reflects key-range order. Use orange only for promoted separators and callout arrows. Use sans-serif for labels and monospaced text for keys; plenty of whitespace.\n\nPanel 1 (top-left) title text: \"Panel 1: Leaf split\".\n- One root internal node labeled \"INTERNAL ROOT\" with separator keys [10 | 20].\n- Three leaf nodes below: Leaf 0 (left), Leaf 1 (center), Leaf 2 (right).\n- Leaf 0 keys: 5. Leaf 1 keys: 12, 15. Leaf 2 keys: 25.\n- Mark Leaf 1 with a small \"FULL\" tag.\n- Add a small orange upward arrow from Leaf 1 toward the root labeled \"insert 18 -> split\".\n\nPanel 2 (top-right) title text: \"Panel 2: Insert separator into parent\".\n- Root internal labeled \"INTERNAL ROOT (NOW FULL)\" with separator keys [10 | 15 | 20].\n- Highlight separator 15 in orange.\n- Four leaf nodes below: Leaf 0 (5), Leaf 1a (12), Leaf 1b (15, 18), Leaf 2 (25).\n- Add a small orange caption under the root: \"promoted separator: 15\".\n\nPanel 3 (bottom-left) title text: \"Panel 3: Parent split\".\n- Show the promoted separator [15] above two internal nodes; add a small orange arrow and label \"promoted up\".\n- Two internal nodes side-by-side: Internal 0 with [10] (left) and Internal 1 with [20] (right).\n- Leaves below: L0 (5) and L1a (12) under Internal 0; L1b (15, 18) and L2 (25) under Internal 1.\n\nPanel 4 (bottom-right) title text: \"Panel 4: New root\".\n- Add a new root box at the top labeled \"NEW ROOT\" containing [15] in orange.\n- NEW ROOT points down to Internal 0 [10] and Internal 1 [20].\n- Leaves below are the same as Panel 3.",
