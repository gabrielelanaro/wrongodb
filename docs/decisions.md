## 2025-12-13: `BlockFile::write_block` does not auto-allocate

**Decision**
- `BlockFile::write_block(block_id, payload)` requires `block_id` to already exist in the file (i.e., `block_id < num_blocks()`).
- New blocks are obtained via `allocate_block()` (and optionally written via `write_new_block(payload)`).

**Why**
- Prevent accidental sparse/implicit file growth via caller-chosen ids, which can hide bugs and produce partially-initialized blocks.
- Keep a clear invariant boundary: allocation/freeing is explicit (needed for B+tree no-overwrite updates, checkpoints, and later recovery/WAL work).
- Closer to WiredTiger’s model: the block manager write path allocates space and returns an opaque “address cookie”, rather than allowing arbitrary overwrites by id.

**Notes**
- We still allow overwriting existing blocks (needed for the header page and for free-list metadata in this simplified engine).
- Future slices (WAL/checkpoint) will likely move callers to “write-new + root swap” patterns, and tighten in-place writes further.
- On-disk header uses `u64` block pointers with `0` meaning “none” (block 0 is reserved for the header page).
- Free space reuse is currently a persisted **singly-linked free list** of block IDs (simple Slice B mechanism).

**Current on-disk layout (Slice A/B)**
```
====================== file ======================+
| page 0 | page 1 | page 2 | page 3 | ... | page N|
+--------+--------+--------+--------+-----+-------+

page 0 (header page):
  +--------------------+-------------------------------+
  | CRC32 (4 bytes)    | header payload (padded)       |
  +--------------------+-------------------------------+
                       | magic[8]                      |
                       | version(u16)                  |
                       | page_size(u32)                |
                       | root_block_id(u64)            |
                       | free_list_head(u64)           |
                       | ...zero padding...            |
                       +-------------------------------+

page k (k > 0):
  +--------------------+-------------------------------+
  | CRC32 (4 bytes)    | payload bytes (padded)        |
  +--------------------+-------------------------------+
```

**Free list encoding (Slice B)**
- `free_list_head == 0` means “no free blocks”.
- If `free_list_head == X`, page `X` is a free block; its payload begins with `next_free(u64)`:
```
header.free_list_head = 7

page 7 payload:
  +----------------------+
  | next_free = 12 (u64) |
  +----------------------+
  | unused/padding...    |
  +----------------------+

page 12 payload:
  +----------------------+
  | next_free = 3 (u64)  |
  +----------------------+

page 3 payload:
  +----------------------+
  | next_free = 0 (u64)  |
  +----------------------+
```

**Allocation / freeing behavior**
- `allocate_block()`:
  - If `free_list_head != 0`, pop the head free block and advance `free_list_head` to `next_free`.
  - Otherwise, append a new page by extending the file length.
- `free_block(id)`:
  - Write the current `free_list_head` into `id`’s payload as `next_free`, then set `free_list_head = id`.

**How this differs from WiredTiger**
- WiredTiger’s block manager is checkpoint-aware and uses extent lists (e.g., alloc/avail/discard) that are snapshotted and merged across checkpoints; it is not a single persisted linked list of block IDs.
- We’re intentionally starting with the simplest persisted allocator; later phases (checkpointing) can evolve toward extent-based free space management.
