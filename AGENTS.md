# Repo agent guidelines

## Decisions log
- When making a non-trivial design/behavior decision (API semantics, file formats, invariants), record it in `docs/decisions.md`.
- Add an entry even if the change is “small” but affects persistence, crash-safety, or public APIs.

## Notes
- Use `NOTES.md` for investigation notes and research summaries.

## Communication style
- Use normal paragraph style for explanations and reviews unless asked otherwise.
- If asked for explanations or reviews with structure, use short, meaningful section titles (not "Chunk N") and small sections; include ASCII diagrams where helpful.
